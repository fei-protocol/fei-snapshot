# Fei Snapshot Repo

Holds contracts used to calculate voting balances on https://snapshot.fei.money

They mimic the ERC-20 `balanceOf(address)` ABI and therefore are compatible with how snapshot calculates balances using archive nodes. A simple ERC-20 rule on the snapshot side is compatible with this approach.
